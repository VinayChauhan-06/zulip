You can customize the logo users see in the top left corner
of the Zulip app. For best results:

* The logo should be a wide rectangle image. It will be displayed at up to
  200×25 pixels.
* For high-resolution displays, upload a 2× or 3× version of your logo.
* Make sure your logo has a transparent background, and trim any bordering
  whitespace.

To upload a logo:

<FlattenedSteps>
  <NavigationSteps target="settings/organization-profile" />

  1. Under **Organization logo**, click the image under **Light theme logo** or
     **Dark theme logo**, and choose a replacement image to upload.
  1. Crop the image as desired, and click **Save changes**.
</FlattenedSteps>

Make sure to test the logo in both light theme and [dark theme](/help/dark-theme).
